# IMPORTANT NOTE
The project may not work on intel / AMD GPU's or any GPU's that have less than 2gb of VRAM. The program is tested to work on mid/low end NVDIA GPU's.

# IMGUI controls:
## Renderer settings:
Re-voxelize:	Updates the voxel representation of the scene, should be done after any geometry changes.<br>
Light pos: 	Position of primary light source. Voxelization needs to occur for changes to be reflected.<br> 
Light scale: 	Scale of primary light source, higher scales result in a brighter scene. Voxelization needs to occur for changes to be reflected.<br>
Light color:	The color of the light emitted from the primary light source. Voxelization needs to occur for changes to be reflected.<br>
Light brightness: The emission strength of the primary light source. Voxelization needs to occur for changes to be reflected.<br>
Ambient RGB:	The ambient color. Color is added based on AO.<br>
Diffuse brightness multiplier:	Multiplies the light received from surfaces, can be used to weak how bright the scene appears.<br>
AO multiplier:	Amplifies the AO term.<br>
Contrast:	Changes the contrast of each fragment.<br>
Horizon color:	Color of sky horizon.<br> 
Zenith color: 	Color of sky zenith.<br>
Filmic tone mapping:	Toggles tone mapping on or off.<br>
Cone aperture:	The aperture of diffuse cones, wider cones sample from lower quality mip maps but captures less fine detail.<br>
Cone step multiplier:	How large each step is when walking along the direction of a cone. <br>
Number of diffuse cones:	How many diffuse cones are traced in a hemisphere. Higher achieves greater detail, at the cost of FPS. <br>
Transmittance needed for cone termination:	When transmittance is below the threshold, the cone gets terminated. A higher number results in performance improvements.<br>
Cone offset:	How far away a cone is traced from a hit surface, exists to avoid self intersection. <br>
Reflection cone aperture:	Aperture of geometry reflection cones, only relevant for smooth surfaces.<br>
Cone max steps:	The max number of steps when walking along a cones direction, lower results in better performance.<br>
Reflection blend lower bound:	The smoothness value needed to start blending specular and geometry reflections, surfaces with smoothness less than this value only receive specular reflections. <br>
Reflection blend upper bound:	The upper bound smoothness value for blending. Everything between this and the lower bound receives a blend of specular, and geometry reflections depending on where it lies in the range. <br>
Gbuffer debug enable:	Toggles debug view for the gbuffer, used in conjunction with the following controls:<br>
Gbuffer show X as RGB:	Samples X as the fragment color, useful for visualizing the gbuffer.<br>
Gbuffer show voxel sampled position as RGB:	Samples the voxel albedo using the gbuffer position. A useful visualization of the voxel representation. <br>
Voxel conservative rasterization:	Enables conservative rasterization for the voxelization pass.<br>
Voxelization render resolution:	The 'viewport' resolution when rendering geometry for voxelization, too high of a value results in little geometry being captured, too low of a value results in poor detail. <br>
Voxel splat radius:	Voxels are placed in a radius for each 'geometry hit'. Results in thicker planes, useful to avoid cones skipping through geometry.<br>
Voxel debug mode:	Enables the voxel debug mode.<br>
Voxel slice:	Determines the Z slice of what to display when using voxel debug mode.<br>
Voxel show X as RGB:	When using voxel debug mode, renders fragments using X as the RGB. <br>

# How to run
The project can be built and run the same way as the CGRA framework, the readme from which is pasted below:

# CGRA OpenGL Base Project

# Requirements

The project requires [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to build before compiling. The recommended way to build to project is to create a build folder then using CMake to create to project inside it. Make sure that you are creating the build folder in the same directory as the work folder.
```sh
$ mkdir build
```

This project also requires OpenGL v3.3 and a suitable C++11 compiler.



## Linux

#### Command Line

The simpliest way to set up a basic project is to run the shell script `runcmake.sh` (`runcmake.bat` for Windows) which runs the `cmake`, `make` and run commands for you.
```sh
$ ./runcmake.sh
```

Alternativiely you can run the commands manually.
```sh
$ cd build
$ cmake ../work
$ make
$ cd ..
```

If the project builds without errors the executable should be located in the `build/bin/` directory and can be run with:
```sh
$ ./build/bin/base [args...]
```

#### Eclipse
Setting up for [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/) is a little more complicated. Navigate to the build folder and run `cmake` for Eclipse.
```sh
$ cd build
$ cmake  -G "Eclipse  CDT4 - Unix  Makefiles" ../work
```
Start Eclipse and go to `File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace`, browse to and select the `build/` directory as the project. Make sure  the  box `Copy  Projects into Workspace` is unchecked. Once you've imported the project, and are unable run it, do the following:
 - Go to `Run > Run  Configurations`.  On the left side, select C/C++  Application, then in the `Main` tab, make sure your C/C++ Application field contains `./bin/base` and that `Enable auto build` is checked.
 - On your project, `[right click] > Run As > C/C++  Application`.  This should setup the default way to start the program, so you can simply run the project anytime after that.

If  you  need  to  run  with  arguments  (and  you  will  with  some  projects)  go  to `Run > Run Configurations > Arguments` and enter your arguments there.  For example: `./work/res/assets/teapot.obj `



## Windows

#### Visual Studio

This project requires at least Visual Studio 2017. You can get the latest, [Visual Studio Community 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/), for free from Microsoft.

| Product |  XX  |
|:-------:|:----:|
| Visual Studio 2017 | 15 |

Run the `cmake` command for Visual Studio with the appropriate version number (XX).
```sh
> cmake -G "Visual Studio XX" ..\work
```

Or if you are building for 64-bit systems.
```sh
> cmake -G "Visual Studio XX Win64" ..\work
```

After opening the solution (`.sln`) you will need to set some additional variables before running.
 - `Solution Explorer > base > [right click] > Set as StartUp Project`
 - `Solution Explorer > base > [right click] > Properties > Configuration Properties > Debugging`
    - Select `All Configurations` from the configuration drop-down
    - Set `Working Directory` to `(SolutionDir)../work`
    - Set `Command Arguments` to whatever is required by your program



## OSX

#### XCode

[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) is an IDE that offers a little more than simple text editing. The setup again is very similar to Eclipse.
```sh
$ cd build
$ cmake -G "Xcode" ../work
$ cd ..
```

Once you're setup, you can build your project with Xcode, but have to execute your program with the terminal (making sure you are in the root directory).
```sh
$ ./build/bin/base [args..]
```
